## Enthusiastic junior frontend


âž¡ Logic and Mathematic enthusiast, I decided many years ago to build a career in digital science. 

âž¡ After a career as a R&D technician I did a carrer change and became a Wordpress web creator.

âž¡ In need of a carrer change and evolution I now have extensive knowledge in React, Nextjs, HTML, CSS, Node.js, Tailwind CSS, Redux, sass ,Typescript, and in Styled component.

âž¡ I have experience working in teams using Git & GitHub and agile methodologies such as SCRUM.

âž¡ I have made many projects such as dynamic and responsive websites and applications using React.

âž¡ I define myself as an easy going and joyful person, who will always be happy to challenge herself. I consider myself an independent learner. I love to explore and discover new technologies by practicing and challenging myself.

âž¡ I love teamwork and had often been praised for my great communication skills. 

âž¡ I am a big puzzle lover, as much as building them as solving them. For me being a web developer is being able to solve a great challenging puzzle. 

  

                         âœˆ Fun facts: I'm a travel addict and I've lived in 8 differents countries.
